Dear Mr. Dr. Pr. Robert Nix,
There are some errors when the projectile is fired, and collides with objects, this isn't crashing the game so we didn't address it as the game wasn't affected by this.  If the server player dies or client doesn't there is a desync issue (most likely would be fixed with lag fix code) Also, if a player runs into an asteroid the player takes damage, but if the player is hit by an asteroid there is no damage taken. We also would like to mention that the player spawns are strange (not sure we set up networking right in the first place) but if the other players don't spawn... just restart the game.
